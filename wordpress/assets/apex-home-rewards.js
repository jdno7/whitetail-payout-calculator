/**
 * APEX home page Rewards Calculator (page 52) - view layer.
 *
 * The numbers used to be hardcoded per band inside
 * apex-competitions-controller/assets/js/submit-score.js, computed with the OLD
 * formula at a $100 entry fee while the contest charges $225 - the page showed
 * $22,500 for 1st against the $25,000 the current rules pay. This drives the
 * same markup from window.ApexPayouts.buildBoard instead.
 *
 * The approved design:
 *   - two columns, 1st-25th left and 26th onwards right, not "top ten" vs
 *     "11th-70th in bands of five";
 *   - the right column mirrored, value on the left and bar filling from the
 *     right (the page's own CSS already lays it out that way);
 *   - the first five rows of EACH column on the red ramp, the rest grey, with
 *     the value text matching its bar;
 *   - bar width is decorative, not a chart of the money: it tapers evenly by
 *     rank from 100% on the top row to 33% on the last, per column, so the
 *     shortest bar does not crowd its value;
 *   - Special Harvest keeps full-width bars in three groups of four.
 *
 * How it touches the page - read this before changing the selectors.
 *
 * Every row is its own Elementor HTML widget: .elementor-widget-html >
 * .elementor-widget-container > .progress-con. A column is therefore the
 * .elementor-widget-wrap holding a run of those widgets, and it is found as the
 * lowest common ancestor of the rows carrying that column's value class. It is
 * NOT found by .elementor-column: an outer nested column holds both lists, and
 * clearing that is what wiped the top ten on the live page once already.
 *
 * Nothing is ever cleared. Existing row widgets are repainted in place, extra
 * ones are cloned from the last row when a band pays more places than the page
 * was built with, and leftovers are hidden. If a container ever comes back
 * holding both columns' rows, the render bails out rather than touch it.
 *
 * Three copies of the section exist and all are handled: f3d97df (paid,
 * .free-challenge-hidden), fe96e71 (.free-challenge-ui, no band dropdown) and
 * 48fb42b2 (hidden at every breakpoint). Which one shows depends on the user's
 * challenge state, not on screen width.
 *
 * The band dropdown is bound DIRECTLY by the plugin rather than delegated, so
 * its click handler is removed from those list items alone. The same file also
 * runs the score-submission popup, the step carousel, the measurement
 * calculator and the video widget, all of which are on this page and are left
 * untouched. Dequeuing it was considered and rejected.
 *
 * Two things outside the rows are written, and nothing else is:
 *   - the column headings, which Chris asked to follow the band, because the
 *     places a column holds change with it - 1st-25th and 26th-51st at a
 *     sellout, 1st-8th and 9th-15th at 250 hunters;
 *   - .apex_payout_number, "Rewards based on N Hunters", because the plugin's
 *     dropdown handler kept that in step and that handler is now gone.
 * Every other heading, caption and widget is left exactly as it is.
