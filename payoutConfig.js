// The model is "purse first": we take a fixed share of gross revenue, then hand
// it out by weight. That is what keeps the house margin steady no matter how
// many hunters enter - the old version calculated each prize on its own and let
// the total land wherever it happened to land (anywhere from 26% to 65%).

    // A thin field pays out more so the board can actually fill: at or below
    // `smallField` entries the house takes 30%, and that eases evenly up to the
    // full 35% by `fullField` entries. It costs very little - about $500 at 50
    // entries and near nothing above that, because on a small board the extra
    // money often cannot be spent anyway once prizes have to land on $50 and
    // clear the floor. What it buys is Special Harvest appearing at 57 entries
    // instead of 88.
